          Hello, I&apos;m Lou. I&apos;m a Software Engineer with a passion for
          learning, reading fantasy novels, and playing video games!
          <br />
          I started learning to code when I attended Community College, where I
          took some Programming courses that taught me the basics of programming
          and data structures. After that I joined Codesmith&apos;s Coding
          Bootcamp, which really opened me up to the world of software
          development and I&apos;ve been hooked ever since.
          <br />
          Nowadays I&apos;m balancing staying healthy, creating new web
          applications, practicing new technologies I&apos;m unfamiliar with,
          and spending time with my fianc√©e exploring the Philadelphia area!
          <br />
          Don&apos;t hesitate to reach out if you want to talk about anything
          software related or want to collaborate on a project together.
